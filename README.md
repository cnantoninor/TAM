# The AI Alchemical Mirror (TAM)

A technical blog exploring the intersection of AI, philosophy, and software development. This repository contains articles and code examples from [The AI Alchemical Mirror](https://antoninorau.substack.com/) Substack publication.

## About

The AI Alchemical Mirror examines how artificial intelligence serves as a reflection of fundamental questions about consciousness, knowledge, identity, and the nature of software development itself. Each article combines philosophical inquiry with practical code examples and software engineering insights.

## Philosophy Meets Code

Each article demonstrates how ancient philosophical questions find new relevance in modern software development:

- **Identity**: How do we model what persists through change?
- **Knowledge**: What can AI really "know" versus pattern match?
- **Memory**: Should systems remember state or story?
- **Context**: How does meaning depend on boundaries?
- **Design**: How do we move from surface-level to intentional problem solving?

## Getting Started

1. **Read the articles**: Start with [TAM1](https://antoninorau.substack.com/) to understand the foundational concepts
2. **Explore the code**: TAM5 contains fully implemented examples in Python
3. **Run the examples**: Each code directory includes setup instructions and tests

## Contributing

This repository serves as a companion to the published articles. Issues and discussions about the philosophical or technical content are welcome.
