# TAM3: AI Changed How I Delete Code—And That Changes Everything

*The impact of AI on software development practices*

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation and article content for TAM3, examining how AI has fundamentally transformed the way developers approach code deletion and maintenance, revealing deeper implications for software development practices.

**Main Question**: What does the psychology of deleting AI-generated code reveal about our changing relationship with software development?

## The Article

**Published**: August 10, 2025  
**Read on Substack**: [AI Changed How I Delete Code And That Changes Everything](https://antoninorau.substack.com/p/ai-changed-how-i-delete-codeand-that)  
**Theme**: The impact of AI on software development practices

### Key Concepts

The article explores the psychological and practical implications of AI-assisted coding through the lens of code deletion:

1. **The Paradox of Painless Deletion**: Why deleting AI code feels different
2. **Three Critical Tests**: Intent, Error Traceability, Knowledge Transfer
3. **New Development Patterns**: Changing relationships with code ownership
4. **Practical Recommendations**: Maintaining human agency in AI workflows

## The Pivotal Moment

> *"I deleted the entire refactor without a second thought."*

The author describes working on an AI-refactored document chunker and experiencing an unprecedented ease of deletion - a moment that revealed a fundamental shift in the developer-code relationship.

## Three Critical Tests for AI's Impact

### 1. Intent Ownership
- **Traditional Tools**: Intent precedes implementation
- **Generative AI**: Intent emerges through iterative dialogue  
- **Implication**: Co-evolution of intent and implementation
- **Risk**: Losing clarity about what we're actually trying to build

### 2. Error Traceability  
- **Traditional Tools**: Clear causal debugging chain
- **Generative AI**: Opaque decision-making process
- **Implication**: Breaks traditional error-learning cycle
- **Risk**: Difficulty understanding and learning from failures

### 3. Knowledge Transferability
- **Traditional Tools**: Abstraction layers teach transferable principles
- **Generative AI**: Limited learning beyond AI collaboration
- **Implication**: Risk of developing AI-specific skills only
- **Risk**: Dependency on AI for problem-solving approaches

## Practical Recommendations

### Maintain Developer Agency
1. **Intent Ledger**: Document the "why" before prompting
2. **Two-Pass Review**: First for correctness, second for learning
3. **Traceability Checklists**: Track decision reasoning
4. **Metrics Monitoring**: 
   - Delete-to-add ratio
   - AI suggestion acceptance rate  
   - Time-to-debug AI code

### The Supervision Framework

> *"Treat AI as a co-author you must supervise, not a vending machine."*

Key principles:
- Maintain human intent throughout the process
- Ensure reasoning transparency in generated solutions
- Extract transferable lessons from AI-assisted work
- Preserve debugging and learning capabilities

## Evidence and Research Findings

### Key Statistics
- **GitHub Copilot**: Increased task completion speed by 55.8%
- **Experience Paradox**: Experienced developers became 19% slower with AI
- **Trust Issues**: 46% of developers distrust AI accuracy
- **Quality Concerns**: Potential security and maintainability risks

### Study Limitations
- Recent adoption effects
- Selection bias in early adopters
- Variability across different development domains
- Long-term impact still unknown

## Code Implementation

The [`code/`](./code/) directory will contain implementations demonstrating:
- Intent tracking systems for AI-assisted development
- Code provenance and traceability tools
- Metrics collection for AI development workflows
- Examples of human-AI collaboration patterns

## Philosophy in Practice

This exploration addresses critical questions for modern software development:
- How do we maintain craftsmanship in an AI-augmented world?
- What skills remain uniquely human in software development?
- How do we balance efficiency gains with learning and growth?
- What does responsible AI adoption look like in practice?

## The Deeper Implications

### For Individual Developers
- Need for new forms of code literacy
- Importance of maintaining debugging skills  
- Developing AI collaboration competencies
- Preserving problem-solving intuition

### For Development Teams
- New code review processes
- AI governance and standards
- Knowledge management in AI workflows
- Balancing speed with understanding

### For the Industry
- Questions about code ownership and liability
- Long-term skill development concerns
- The evolution of software engineering education
- Economic implications of AI-assisted development

## Discussion Questions

- How do you maintain ownership over AI-generated code?
- What debugging skills become more important in an AI world?
- How can teams balance AI efficiency with human learning?
- What would "responsible AI adoption" look like in your organization?

## Key Insights

> *"The ease of deleting AI code isn't just about efficiency—it's about our changing relationship with the craft of software development."*

- The psychology of code deletion reveals deeper questions about ownership and craft
- AI assistance requires new frameworks for maintaining human agency
- The challenge isn't just technical but fundamentally about preserving learning and growth
- Responsible AI adoption means designing workflows that enhance rather than replace human judgment
