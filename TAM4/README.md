# TAM4: From Vibe Coding to Vibe Designing

*Why the future of AI is less about speed and more about shaping the right problems to solve*

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation and article content for TAM4, exploring the evolution from rapid AI-assisted code generation to using AI as a cognitive lever for deeper problem understanding and intentional design.

**Main Question**: How can we move beyond "vibe coding" to use AI for deeper problem modeling and design thinking?

## The Article

**Published**: August 17, 2025  
**Read on Substack**: [From Vibe Coding to Vibe Designing](https://antoninorau.substack.com/p/from-vibe-coding-to-vibe-designing)  
**Theme**: Moving beyond rapid code generation to using AI as a cognitive lever for deeper problem understanding and intentional design

### Key Concepts

The article challenges the speed-focused narrative around AI in software development:

1. **The Velocity Trap**: Why speed isn't the real bottleneck
2. **Understanding vs. Speed**: The fundamental challenge of comprehension
3. **Vibe Designing**: Using AI for deeper problem modeling
4. **The Socratic Partnership**: AI as a tool for questioning assumptions

## The Velocity Trap

> *"Good prompting is a result of deep understanding, not a substitute for it."*

The article argues that the primary benefit of AI isn't typing faster, but thinking more clearly about problems. Key insights:

- The real bottleneck isn't code production speed
- More code doesn't equal better solutions
- Context and domain understanding remain critical
- AI can miss crucial nuances without proper guidance

## Core Problem: Understanding vs. Speed

### The False Promise of Speed
- AI can generate code quickly, but may miss critical contextual nuances
- Rapid iteration without deep understanding can lead to technical debt
- The typing speed analogy: doubling typing speed doesn't double programming productivity

### The Real Opportunity
Using AI to:
- Deepen problem modeling and domain understanding
- Clarify assumptions and invariants
- Shape better problem definitions
- Explore design alternatives systematically

## Vibe Designing: A Practical Framework

### The 6-Minute Pre-Prompting Process

**Before Prompting (3 minutes):**
- Write domain invariants and business rules
- List potential edge cases and failure modes  
- Sketch entity lifecycles and state transitions

**While Prompting (2 minutes):**
- Challenge initial assumptions with AI
- Request counter-models and alternative approaches
- Generate adversarial test scenarios

**After Prompting (1 minute):**
- Evaluate how the model changes your domain understanding
- Capture new domain language and concepts
- Convert examples to executable tests

### The Socratic Partnership

> *"AI as a Socratic partner—a tool for questioning assumptions and exploring design variations, not a replacement for human judgment."*

Key principles:
- Use AI to challenge your problem framing
- Explore alternative models and approaches
- Generate questions you haven't considered
- Validate assumptions through dialogue

## Code Implementation

The [`code/`](./code/) directory will contain implementations demonstrating:
- Domain modeling tools and frameworks
- Assumption tracking and validation systems
- Design exploration and comparison utilities
- Socratic prompting templates and workflows

## Practical Examples

### Traditional Approach
```
Prompt: "Write a user authentication system"
Result: Generic auth code without context
```

### Vibe Designing Approach
```
Before: What are our domain invariants? Security requirements? Edge cases?
Prompt: "Given these constraints... explore authentication models that..."
Result: Context-aware, domain-specific solutions
```

## Philosophy in Practice

This approach addresses fundamental questions about AI-assisted development:
- How do we use AI to enhance rather than replace thinking?
- What does "good judgment" look like in AI collaboration?
- How do we maintain design intentionality at scale?
- What role does domain expertise play in an AI world?

## The Paradigm Shift

### From Vibe Coding
- Focus: Generate code quickly
- Process: Prompt → Code → Deploy
- Outcome: Fast but potentially shallow solutions
- Risk: Technical debt, missed requirements

### To Vibe Designing  
- Focus: Understand problems deeply
- Process: Model → Explore → Validate → Code
- Outcome: Intentional, context-aware solutions
- Benefit: Better architecture, fewer surprises

## Competitive Advantage

> *"The teams that win won't just be the fastest—they'll be the clearest."*

### Clarity as Competitive Edge
- Better problem understanding leads to better solutions
- Domain expertise becomes more valuable, not less
- Design thinking skills become critical differentiators
- The ability to ask good questions becomes paramount

### Long-term Benefits
- Reduced technical debt
- More maintainable systems
- Better alignment with business needs
- Stronger domain models

## Key Insights

### For Individual Developers
- Develop domain modeling skills
- Practice Socratic questioning techniques
- Focus on problem clarity before solution speed
- Use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement

### for Development Teams
- Invest in domain understanding
- Create processes for assumption validation
- Develop shared design vocabularies
- Balance speed with intentionality

### For Organizations
- Reward clarity and understanding, not just velocity
- Invest in domain expertise and business context
- Create space for design exploration
- Measure quality alongside speed

## Discussion Questions

- How can we measure the quality of problem understanding?
- What does "good design judgment" look like in practice?
- How do we balance exploration time with delivery pressure?
- What skills become most valuable in an AI-assisted design world?

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Institute pre-prompting rituals**: Always model before coding
2. **Practice Socratic prompting**: Use AI to challenge assumptions
3. **Create design artifacts**: Capture insights for future reference
4. **Validate through dialogue**: Test understanding with stakeholders
5. **Measure clarity metrics**: Track assumption validation and model evolution
