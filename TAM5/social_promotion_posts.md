6) Notes/Social Teasers (3 Variants) 
Variant 1 (X/Twitter): 
The Ship of Theseus isn't just a philosophy 101 puzzle. It's a core challenge in software design. 
Is a software entity defined by its current state or its history? 
Domain-Driven Design offers a ladder of answers, from simple Entities to Event Sourcing, where 
identity becomes a story. A thread on software as applied philosophy. üèõüíª 
Variant 2 (LinkedIn): 
How do we model identity in complex systems? The ancient paradox of the Ship of Theseus 
offers a surprisingly relevant framework. 
In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), we grapple with this daily. Is a User entity just its current set of 
attributes, or is it the sum of all its past actions? 
This distinction between state-based modeling and Event Sourcing isn't just technical‚Äîit's a 
choice about how our systems remember and what stories they can tell. A short essay on the 
intersection of ancient philosophy and modern software architecture. #DDD

Variant 3 (Substack Notes): 
A short reflection from my latest essay: We often think of software design as a purely technical 
discipline. But when we model an 'Entity' in our code, we are making a philosophical claim about 
what it means for something to persist through change. The Ship of Theseus paradox‚Äîwhere 
every plank of a ship is replaced‚Äîforces the question: What is the anchor of identity? Is it the 
parts, or the story? In DDD, this is the choice between a simple state model and the narrative 
power of Event Sourcing. Our architectures are stories we tell about the world.
